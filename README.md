## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Space Invaders was developed as part of a Python lecture, where the ultimate challenge was to create a game using the powerful Pygame package. This project served as an opportunity to explore the realm of game development while honing skills in rendering game models and handling user input.

The game revolves around defending the planet from invading alien forces by maneuvering a spaceship and shooting down the relentless invaders. By building this game, I gained hands-on experience in high-level programming languages like Python and witnessed firsthand the simplicity and effectiveness of game rendering in such environments.
## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
All you will need to get started is an updated version of Python3.

Installing Python3 on linux

```
sudo apt update

sudo apt install python3
```

### Prerequisites

Pygame-
```
python3 -m pip install pygame
```

Font Config-
```
sudo apt-get install fontconfig
```

### Running
After downloading Python3 and installing prerequisites you can now run the game using following command!
```
python3 main.py
```
