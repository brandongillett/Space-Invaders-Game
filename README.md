  This project was created during a python lecture, where the final project was to create a game using pygame. The main takeaway from this project was simple rendering in a higher-level programming language (Python).

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The purpose of this project was to get an in-depth understanding of object-oriented programming in Python as well as using pip packages such as pygame to render game models and register keystrokes. This was definitely not the hardest project I have taken on, but never the less, this was quite challenging, even with walkthroughs taught by my professor during lectures.
## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
All you will need to get started is an updated version of Python3.

Installing Python3 on linux

```
sudo apt update

sudo apt install python3
```

### Prerequisites

Pygame-
```
python3 -m pip install pygame

```

Font Config-
```
sudo apt-get install fontconfig

```

### Running
After downloading Python3 and installing prerequisites you can now run the game using following command!

```
python3 main.py
```
